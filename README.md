# Weather Data Analysis

This project analyzes the average temperature and rainfall data across several months. The following plots are included:

1. **Line Chart**: Displays the average temperature (°C) for each month.
2. **Bar Chart**: Displays the rainfall (mm) for each month.
3. **Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between temperature and rainfall.

### Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Month`: The name of the month.
- `Avg_Temp`: The average temperature (°C) for that month.
- `Rainfall`: The total rainfall (mm) for that month.

### Analysis

- **Temperature Trend**: Temperature increases as the months progress, indicating a rise in temperature over time.
- **Rainfall Trend**: Rainfall decreases as we move towards the warmer months, suggesting that rainfall tends to be higher in cooler months.
- **Temperature vs Rainfall**: There is an inverse relationship between temperature and rainfall, where higher temperatures are generally associated with less rainfall.

### Requirements
To run the analysis, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

Install the necessary libraries with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
